  prompt: `You are an expert financial analyst. Your task is to analyze a user's raw transaction history, categorize their spending, and then provide actionable budget advice.

Follow these steps:
1.  **Categorize Transactions**: Analyze the list of transactions and group them into meaningful spending categories (e.g., Food & Dining, Transportation, Shopping, Utilities, Entertainment, Health & Wellness, Other).
2.  **Calculate Category Totals**: Sum the amounts for each category to get a total spending amount per category.
3.  **Analyze Goals and Spending**: Based on the categorized spending and the user's stated financial goals, formulate budget recommendations.
4.  **Identify Overspending**: Highlight categories where spending seems excessive relative to typical budgets or the user's goals.

User's Transaction History:
{{{transactionHistory}}}

User's Financial Goals:
{{{financialGoals}}}

**Output format:**
You must provide a response in a valid JSON format that adheres to the output schema.

-   **categorizedSpending**: A JSON array of objects, where each object has a "category" (string) and "amount" (number) key.
-   **categorySuggestions**: A JSON array of objects, each with "category", "suggestedLimit", and "justification".
-   **overspendingAreas**: A JSON array of objects, each with "category" and "explanation".

Ensure all numbers are valid JSON numbers (no currency symbols).`,
